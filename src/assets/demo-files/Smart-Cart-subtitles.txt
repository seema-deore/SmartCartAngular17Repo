Smart Cart is my recent showcase E-Commerce web app  built with Angular 17.
The landing page looks interactive and dynamic with CSS animations and key frames.
App uses lazy-loaded standalone components with defer for performance optimization.
and even banner images are loaded lazily for fast performance.
I used Bootstrap 5 and media queries to make it fully responsive for all devices,  here I showed mobile app view.
With 25+ APIs and services , the app delivers a smooth and seamless shopping experience.
Reactive forms handle user registration with validations. After login, a unique token is stored and used in AuthGuard to protect routes.
Product details use parameterized routes, and the cart auto-updates using Behavior Subject state management.
Custom Services with API , manages Wish List items.
‘../GetCartProductsByCustomerId?id=’ this API list cart products and managed to place order.
User can view filtered products category wise and search by content using custom Pipe

The Admin dashboard uses ng2-charts and Chart.js for analytics.
Admin can also add, update, or delete products and categories through APIs.
I’m excited to keep improving and take on new challenges ahead.
